            Obfuscat
        </h1>     
        Obfuscat is a tool to apply obfuscation techniques with predictable overhead. This means that for a given input program the obfuscated programs will be internally different, but the output size and the amount of instructions that need to be executed will always be the same. This can be useful when having hard-resource limits and many versions of a program are wanted. For more information on the design and reasoning behind it, see my thesis.
